# NEC-03 Code Builder Signatures

Services running in AWS Nitro Enclave can report their `PCR values` in their attestations. When the code images are built for the enclave, the images might be signed and the key's fingerprint would then be reported as `PCR8` value in the attestation. We use this feature to bind the build to a particular Nostr key.

## Image Signing

When the `builder` creates the `enclave image file` (`EIF`) they MAY:

1. Generate a `secp384r1` curve key:
```bash
openssl ecparam -name secp384r1 -genkey -out path/to/key.pem
```

2. Sign a x509 certificate issued for the Nostr `pubkey` of the `builder`, using subject of `/CN=<npub(builder.pubkey)/O=Nostr`:
```bash
openssl req -new -key path/to/key.pem -sha384 -nodes -subj "/CN=<npub(builder.pubkey)/O=Nostr" -out path/to/req
openssl x509 -req -days 2000 -in path/to/req -out path/to/cert.pem -sha384 -signkey path/to/key.pem
```

3. Build an EIF image signed by the x509 key with `PCR8` set to the fingerprint of the above certificate:
```bash
nitro-cli build-enclave --docker-uri <uri> --output-file path/to/image.eif --private-key path/to/key.pem --signing-certificate path/to/cert.pem
```

4. Delete the cert key to make sure it can't be reused:
```bash
rm path/to/key.pem
```

5. Create a `Builder signature` Nostr event of `kind:23794` with the above x509 cert, a link to git repo and package version (i.e. from package.json):
```js
{
  "id": <event_id>,
  "created_at": <timestamp>,
  "pubkey": <builder pubkey>,
  "kind": 23794,
  "content": <optional comment>,
  "tags": [
    ["-"], // not for publishing
    ["r", <git repo url>],
    ["v", <package version>],
    ["cert", <PEM-encoded body of x509 cert>],
    ["t", <"prod" or "dev">]
  ]
}
```

## Signature Usage

The `builder signature` event MAY be included as `build` tag in `announcement` events of `kind:13793` ([NEC-02](./02.md)) so that clients could take the `builder` identity into account while discovering the services. In this case, it is recommended to also add `p` tag with `builder pubkey` and a `builder` marker to the `announcement`.

```js
{
  "id": <event_id>,
  "create_at": <timestamp>,
  "pubkey": <service pubkey>,
  "kind": 13793,
  "content": <optional comment>,
  "tags":[
    ["tee_root", <attestation event>],
    ["build", "\{\"id\": <sig event id>,\"created_at\": <timestamp>,\"pubkey\": <builder pubkey>,\"kind\": 23794,\"content\": <optional comment>,\"tags\": \[\[\"cert\", <x509 cert>\],\[\"r\",<repo url>\]\]\}"],
    ["p", <builder pubkey>, "builder"]
  ]
}
```

The `builder signature` event SHOULD be injected into the service by the parent instance dynamically, and not statically hard-coded into the code image, to avoid changing the main `PCR` values.

## Signature Validation

Clients that encounter the `announcement` events with `builder signature` included as `build` tag and AWS Nitro Enclave `attestation` included as `tee_root` tag MAY validate them:
- parse and validate the x509 certificate from `cert` tag of `build signature` event, it must be a self-signed certificate with `O=Nostr` and `OU` equal to npub of the `build signature` event
- take `sha384` hash of the `raw data` of the certificate - the cert `fingerprint`
- create `PCR8` from the above `fingerprint` and compare it with the value from the `attestation`
- compare `r` and `t` tags from the `builder signature` with same tags of the `announcement`

NOTE: only trust the `builder signature` events that are included in `announcement` events by the service.

## PCR hashes

The `PCR` hash value is calculated by taking a `sha384` hash of the data starting with a [zero state](https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-cli/issues/446#issuecomment-1460766038):

> The PCR registers start in a known zero state and each extend operation does a hash between the previous state and the data.

Example:
```js
    const PCR8 = bytesToHex(sha384
      .create()
      // zero state
      .update(new Uint8Array(384 / 8))
      // cert fingerprint
      .update(data)
      .digest()
    )
```
