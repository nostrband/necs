# NEC-05 Code Release Signatures

Services running in AWS Nitro Enclave can report their `PCR values` in their attestations. The `PCR0`, `PCR1` and `PCR2` entries are the hashes of the code image. We are using these values to signal "approval" by code `maintainers`.

## Release Signature Event

Code `maintainers` may create a `kind:63794` event called `release signature` with `x` tags for `PCR0`, `PCR1` and `PCR2` that match the "approved" values of a particular code release. It SHOULD also and the `r` tag with a link to git repo, and `t` tag with `prod` or `dev` value (default - `dev`).  
```js
{
  "id": <event id>,
  "created_at": <timestamp>,
  "pubkey": <maintainer pubkey>,
  "kind": 63794,
  "content": <optional comment>,
  "tags": [
    ["r", <git repo link>],
    ["t", <"prod" or "dev">],
    ["x", <PCR0>, "PCR0"],
    ["x", <PCR1>, "PCR1"],
    ["x", <PCR2>, "PCR2"],
  ]
}
```

## Signature Usage

The `release signature` events MAY be published on relays to help with discovery of service instances. They MAY also be included as `release` tags in `announcement` events of `kind:13793` ([NEC-02](./02.md)) so that clients could take the `maintainer` identities into account while discovering the services. In this case, it is recommended to also add `p` tags with `maintainer pubkey` and a `releaser` marker to the `announcement`.

```js
{
  "id": <event_id>,
  "create_at": <timestamp>,
  "pubkey": <service pubkey>,
  "kind": 13793,
  "content": <optional comment>,
  "tags":[
    ["tee_root", <attestation event>],
    ["release", "\{\"id\": <sig event id1>,\"created_at\": <timestamp>,\"pubkey\": <maintainer pubkey1>,\"kind\": 63794,\"content\": <optional comment>,\"tags\": \[\[\"r\",<git repo link>\],\[\"x\", <PCR0>, \"PCR0\"\],\[\"x\", <PCR1>, \"PCR1\"\],\[\"x\", <PCR2>, \"PCR2\"\]\]\}"],
    ["release", "\{\"id\": <sig event id2>,\"created_at\": <timestamp>,\"pubkey\": <maintainer pubkey2>,\"kind\": 63794,\"content\": <optional comment>,\"tags\": \[\[\"r\",<git repo link>\],\[\"x\", <PCR0>, \"PCR0\"\],\[\"x\", <PCR1>, \"PCR1\"\],\[\"x\", <PCR2>, \"PCR2\"\]\]\}"],
    ["p", <maintainer pubkey1>, "releaser"],
    ["p", <maintainer pubkey2>, "releaser"]
  ]
}
```

The `release signature` events SHOULD be injected into the service by the parent instance dynamically, as they cannot be statically hard-coded into the code image.

## Signature Validation

Clients that encounter the service `announcement` event with an `attestation` and `release signature` events (from relays or included in the `announcement`) MAY validate them by comparing the `PCR0`, `PCR1`, `PCR2`, `r` and `t` tags from the `release signature` with `PCR0`, `PCR1` and `PCR2` values from the `attestation` and `r` and `t` tags from the `announcement`. 

NOTE: `release signature` events discovered outside of `announcement` events MAY be used by clients as additional signal of approval by third parties.
