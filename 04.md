# NEC-04 Enclave Launcher Signatures

Services running in AWS Nitro Enclave can report their `PCR values` in their attestations. The `PCR4` entry is the hash of AWS EC2 `instance id`, which is a globally unique, non-transferable identifier of the parent server that is running the enclave. We are using this feature to bind the enclave instance to a particular Nostr key.

## Launcher Signature Event

Owner of the EC2 instance may create a `kind:23795` event called `launcher signature` with a tag `PCR4` that is a [PCR-hash](./03.md#pcr-hashes) of the `instance id`:
```js
{
  "id": <event id>,
  "created_at": <timestamp>,
  "pubkey": <launcher pubkey>,
  "kind": 23795,
  "content": <optional comment>,
  "tags": [
    ["-"], // not for publishing
    ["PCR4", <pcrHash(instance_id)>]
  ]
}
```

## Signature Usage

The `launcher signature` event MAY be included as `instance` tag in `announcement` events of `kind:13793` ([NEC-02](./02.md)) so that clients could take the `launcher` identity into account while discovering the services. In this case, it is recommended to also add `p` tag with `launcher pubkey` and a `launcher` marker to the `announcement`.

```js
{
  "id": <event_id>,
  "create_at": <timestamp>,
  "pubkey": <service pubkey>,
  "kind": 13793,
  "content": <optional comment>,
  "tags":[
    ["tee_root", <attestation event>],
    ["instance", "\{\"id\": <sig event id>,\"created_at\": <timestamp>,\"pubkey\": <launcher pubkey>,\"kind\": 23795,\"content\": <optional comment>,\"tags\": \[\[\"PCR4\", <pcrHash(instance_id)>\]\]\}"],
    ["p", <launcher pubkey>, "launcher"]
  ]
}
```

The `launcher signature` event SHOULD be injected into the service by the parent instance dynamically, and not statically hard-coded into the code image, to avoid changing the main `PCR` values.

## Signature Validation

Clients that encounter the `announcement` events with `launcher signature` included as `instance` tag and AWS Nitro Enclave `attestation` included as `tee_root` tag MAY validate them by comparing the `PCR4` tag from the `launcher signature` with `PCR4` value from the `attestation`. 

NOTE: only trust the `launcher signature` events that are included in `announcement` events by the service.
