# NEC-02 Enclaved Service Announcement

Services running inside TEE may announce themselves on Nostr relays using a replaceable `kind:13793` `announcement` event.

The `announcement` event SHOULD include:
- `content` field with service description
- `tee_root` tag with `tee attestation` event by the same `pubkey` (see [NEC-01](./01.md))
- `expiration` tag with timestamp matching the expiration time of the `tee_root`
- `r` tag with a git repo link
- `t` tag with values of `prod` or `dev`, default is `dev`, to discern production instances from dev/previews
- `x` tags, one for each useful PCR hash (at least 0, 1 and 2), with `PCR<n>` markers, to help with discovery
- `relay` tags if the service uses relays to communicate with clients
- `name` tag with short service name
- `v` tag with package version (i.e. from package.json)

Example:
```js
{
  "id": <event_id>,
  "created_at": <timestamp>,
  "pubkey": <service pubkey>,
  "kind": 13793,
  "content": <service description>,
  "tags": [
    // required
    ["r": <git repo link>],
    ["t", <"prod" or "dev">],
    ["tee_root", <stringified tee attestation event>],
    ["expiration", <expiration from tee_root>]
    ["x", <PCR0>, "PCR0"],
    ["x", <PCR1>, "PCR1"],
    ["x", <PCR2>, "PCR2"],
    // optional
    ["name", <service name>],
    ["v", <package version>],
    ["relay", <service inbox relay>],
    ["x", <PCR4>, "PCR4"],
    ["x", <PCR8>, "PCR8"]
  ]
}
```

`Announcement` events should be published to relays that specific niche clients are expected to use for discovery. They should be republished regularly to keep the `tee_root` tag valid. 

## Validation

Clients SHOULD re-fetch and validate the announcements regularly and SHOULD NOT trust the `pubkey` after the `expiration` timestamp. 

Clients SHOULD validate:
- `tee_root` is valid and is signed by the same `pubkey` and it's `expiration` is not earlier than one in the `announcement`
- `x` tags match the `PCR` values from the content of `tee_root`
